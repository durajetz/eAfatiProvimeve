## How does it work?

Currently **eAfatiProvimeve** is implemented only for FIEK bachelor exams based on **[Exam schedule](https://fiek.uni-pr.edu/desk/inc/media/CFBB3C9D-3688-4C00-9CE8-397BB1FF12B2.pdf)**.

>e.g. The exam deadline starts on September 27 (*The first Monday*), 2021
based on the **Exam schedule** the exam *'Data Mining'* is held on the **2nd TUESDAY** (05.10.2021)
so eAfatiProvimeve automatically generates the correct date and fills the fields of event with date,location,start time and end time for that particular exam.
